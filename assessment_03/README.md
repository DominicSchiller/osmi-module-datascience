### Tasks
> 1. Set Up your IDE or at least a good editor for Python with a Python mode/support! (name + personal screenshot included)<br /><br />
> 2. Write a tiny game or everything else in Python to get fluent in Python. No fancy graphics needed. A tic-tac-toe on console is fine. If you already wrote Python code, send me the GitHub Link or a part of the code in the PDF with an explanation (I will Goole the code, so no copycat, please ;-)

Derive a decision tree using SciKit Learn as given in the Python example before! Print the tree with Graphviz (can be easily done with WebGraphViz [[2]](http://www.webgraphviz.com/))

-----
### Solutions
#### Task 1
Please have a look at the python script [Decision_Tree_Demo.py](https://github.com/dominicSchiller/DataScience_EA11_Decision_Trees/blob/develop/Decision_Tree_Demo.py) which was used the descision tree [computer_purchase_decision.png](https://github.com/dominicSchiller/DataScience_EA11_Decision_Trees/blob/develop/computer_purchase_decision.png).<br /><br />
The original graphviz file exported by the python script can be found here: [computer_purchase_decision_tree.dot](https://github.com/dominicSchiller/DataScience_EA11_Decision_Trees/blob/develop/computer_purchase_decision_tree.dot)

### Tasks
> 1. You are walking in the forrest and see an iris and measure:<br />
> `[ 4.8, 2.5, 5.3, 2.4 ]`<br />
> Is this an Iris Virginica or not?<br />
> There is no need to implement a complete python solution. You can also change the given script and derive 4 probabilities from the graphics!

### Solutions
The performed *logistic regression* indicated, that the Iris, given by it's properties <br />`[ 4.8, 2.5, 5.3, 2.4 ]`, ***is an Iris-Virginica***.<br />
For the full performed *logistic regression*, please have a look on the Jupyter notebook [LogisticRegression_on_Iris.ipynb](https://github.com/dominicSchiller/DataScience_EA9_LogisticRegression/blob/develop/LogisticRegression_on_Iris.ipynb)

### Tasks
> 1. Have a look at the following dataset: [dsm-beuth-edl-demodata-orig](https://github.com/edlich/eternalrepo/blob/master/DS-WAHLFACH/dsm-beuth-edl-demodata-dirty.csv).<br />
> Write a Python / Panda Script which 'cleans' this data set. Justify your actions in the respective notebook or python script you provide as a solution (link, file, kaggle repo, etc.).<br />
> The original dataset does not necessarily have to be created. A proper strategy / good arguments are more important. Value: 5 points.<br /><br />
> 2. Do the [Kaggle Data Challenge](https://mailchi.mp/kaggle.com/5-day-data-challenge-data-cleaning-day-1?e=08afe8bf5d) by Rachel Tatman.<br />
> This course has 5 days & topics:<br />
>   *  [Day 1: Handling missing values](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values)
>   *  [Day 2: Scaling and normalization](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-scale-and-normalize-data)
>   *  [Day 3: Parsing dates](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-parsing-dates/)
>   *  [Day 4: Character encodings](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-character-encodings/)
>   *  [Day 5: Inconsistent Data Entry](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/data-cleaning-challenge-inconsistent-data-entry/)
